The purpose of this program is to enter in a student's score and display the results 
and grade of a student essay.

The Essay class extends the graded activity class to inherit the methods.

An Essay class object named finalScore is created in order to pass and
return the variables to get a result.

Created global variables for the grammar, content, spelling and correctlength scores.

In main, a joption.pane asks for you to enter the student's name.

It then asks you to enter in the number for each of the criteria with
an if and do-while input validation statement to keep within the bounds of 
the critera.

The totals of each are then tallied up in scoreTotal, and is passed to the
gradedactivity class where it will set and get the score. The score is then compared
in the getGrade method where if it meets a certain criteria, it will return a 
char that contains the letter grade that the student earned.

In a joption pane, it displays the student's name and displays their final score,
and the letter grade they earned. 

The window closes and a new one opens which displays the individual scores
that they earned for the 4 grading criteria, and the window closes and the
program terminates.
